# AtliQ Hardware Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project involved the development of a Power BI dashboard to analyze AtliQ Hardware's sales performance. AtliQ Hardware, a computer hardware and peripheral distributor with branches across India, faced challenges in understanding its sales performance and identifying factors contributing to declining sales.  The dashboard provides a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware's sales director struggled to gain a clear picture of business performance.  Reliance on regional managers for updates proved inefficient, as they were often uncomfortable interpreting raw data from spreadsheets. This lack of clear, readily digestible information hindered effective decision-making.

## Solution

A Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize sales data and facilitate data-driven decisions.  This dashboard provides key insights into revenue, profit margins, market performance, customer contributions, and product performance.

## Project Methodology

The project followed these key steps:

1.  **Project Planning:** Utilized the AIMS grid for project planning.
2.  **Data Extraction:** Retrieved data from the MySQL database using appropriate queries.
3.  **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned and preprocessed the data within Power Query.
4.  **ETL Process:** Performed Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations.
5.  **Measure Creation:** Developed DAX measures to support analysis and visualization.
6.  **Currency Conversion:** Standardized currency data by converting all transactions to a single currency.
7.  **Data Validation:** Ensured data accuracy and consistency.
8.  **Data Modeling and Visualization:** Created a robust data model and developed insightful visualizations in Power BI.
